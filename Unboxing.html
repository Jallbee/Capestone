    <h1>Unboxing and Review</h1>
    <p>As a small social media team this is our huge start into the gaming industry as reviewers and we are taking it so seriously. We first started by getting our collection of products from the convention and taking them back to our hotel room where we filmed our first attempt at an unboxing only to not like how it came out and deciding to redo it.
