    <h1>Unboxing and Review</h1>
    <p> As a small social media team this is our huge start into the gaming industry as reviewers and we are taking it so seriously. We first started by getting our collection of products from the convention and taking them back to our hotel room where we filmed our first attempt at an unboxing only to not like how it came out and deciding to redo it. Not only did I have to redo the edit but I had the chance to use my Audio Media classes to take the wording in the original video and fix it. I also had to figure out how to work around a color fix as for some reason Davinci Resolve as white washing the videos and we had to find a way to fix it.
