    <h1>Research</h1>
    <p>
    	My experience at Pax East as well as working on a social media team, I have become fascinated by how these companies use social media for marketing. For the research part I decided to focus my research on social media marketing and how specifically the gaming industry uses social media. I also Reached out to Arrowhead and Intersloth to hear first hand about how social media effected the growth of their games</p>
    	<br>
<h1> Arrowhead</h1>
<p> Arrowhead is the game studio who created Helldivers2. </p>
    	<br>
      <h1> Intersloth</h1>
      <p> Intersloth is the game studio who created Among us.</p>
      <br>
<p> Social media has revolutionized marketing in general, but if there is one industry who is using social media the most and that would be the gaming industry. Social media has been crucial for the gaming industry for a few key reasons. The first is that it allows game developers and companies to directly connect with players, share updates and get feedback. Next it makes it huge for building a community around the game. With this connection it boosts player engagement.

With the interactive nature of social media it also enables better communication with the developers sometimes even before the game is released. Developers have been able to collaborate with players by using social media to release beta testing and even crowdsourcing ideas. With not only the popularity of social media but also the gaming community many companies have also used social media and video games to hold contests and even marketing in the games themselves.
