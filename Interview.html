    <h1>Interview</h1>
    <p>When we were attending pax we found this company called Heavy Play. Heavy Play is a company in their first year of business in the collectible trading card game industry. They started as a kickstarter. They are products made by gamers for gamers. We discovered them as one of our team members listened to their pitch and loved the ideas behind their products. From here all of us purchased some of the products and in talking with the director of marketing Ryan he loved our voice and wanted to start to expand into the non competitive scene, thus giving us the opportunity to create a review and unboxing for them.
